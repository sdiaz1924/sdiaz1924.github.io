I"x<p>Anyone from Chicago is well aware of the current surge in carjackings across the City. Several local news outlets have highlighted the issue in recent weeks. The City Council Public Safety Committee held a <a href="https://vimeo.com/user100351763/review/503215814/a40f1d1a97?sort=lastUserActionEventDate&amp;direction=desc">public hearing</a> to discuss what could be done to address the issue. There is even a community run Facebook group, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/chicagostolencardirectory">called The Chicago Stolen Car Directory</a>, that is helping Chicago residents retrieve their stolen cars. According to <a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2021/02/03/with-car-heists-at-record-levels-citizen-sleuths-take-to-facebook-to-recover-stolen-cars/">Block Club Chicago</a>, the group has helped recover more than 200 cars in December and January.</p>

<p>I got curious to see what long term trends for carjackings in Chicago look like, and I figured this would be a good opportunity to practice some data visualizations skills. To do this I gathered <a href="">crime data</a> from the <a href="">Chicago’s Data Portal</a>. Just a quick caveat, crime data from Chicago’s Data Portal may differ slightly from numbers the Chicago Police Department(CPD) may report. If there are differences in my numbers versus what CPD has reported to news outlets, that is likely the cause.</p>

<p>First, I wanted to see what the City’s violent crime rate has looked like over the years. According to the <a href="">National Institute of Justice</a>, violent crime is defined as, an incident where a victim is harmed by or threatened by violence. Violent crimes include rape and sexual assault, robbery, assault and murder. I filtered the crime data to only include these types of offenses.</p>
