Chicago’s industrial corridors date back as far as 1865, when the city opened what is now the Stockyards Industrial Corridor on the South Side of Chicago. Today Chicago has 24 industrial corridors. The purpose of industrial corridor designations is to facilitate the growth of manufacturing in Chicago. However, with a nationwide decline in manufacturing in the U.S., Chicago’s manufacturing sector is not as prominent as it once was.

As these industrial corridors have become vacant, residential redevelopments have occurred in these areas. Take for example the West Loop neighborhood. One concern with residential redevelopments in these areas that may still have operational factories, is the increased risk of exposure to pollution. I was curious to see if the prevalence of asthma is higher in industrial corridors and in the surrounding areas.

The Centers for Disease Control collects data on asthma prevalence across the U.S. and they have prevalence data to the census tract level. I mapped that data with an overlay of the industrial corridors. On the West Side of Chicago there’s a cluster of high asthma prevalence and that cluster is surrounded by 4 different industrial corridors (Kinzie, Northwest, Roosevelt/Cicero and Western/Ogden corridors). However, there is also a cluster of higher asthma prevalence on the South Side of Chicago that is distant from corridors. Additionally, there are industrial corridors in other parts of the city that have lower asthma prevalence rates.

A big caveat to take into account here is that asthma is most often developed at a younger age and people may reside in different neighborhoods than the ones they grew up in. Additionally, there are several other socioeconomic and health factors to take into account that may play a significant role in asthma prevalence.
